                <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays</a>
                <p>Overlays can be useful for displaying information and forms that are small enough to fit onto an overlay, and can be
                useful if navigating to a new page is not optimal. This can be an issue for mobile users though, since overlays on
                mobile are significantly harder to feel comfortable on a mobile sized screen. Since a lot of internet traffic is on
                mobile devices, it is imperative that much consideration is put into making overlays on websites.</p>
                <p>Designers must take into account how the users are navigating the content in the overlay for accessibility and cognitive
                load. Overlays that are not initiated by the user may be instantly ignored and closed, and might even be annoying and
                make the user not enjoy the website experience. The information displayed or needed to be inputted must be clear and
                relevant to where the user is on the website do reduce confusion. Overlays should thus be used for vital information, or
                risk being ignored or an annoyance to the user.</p>

                <h2>Form Design Research</h2>
                <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>
                
                <p>Learning about the best practices for form design was very helpful for my understanding of what exactly makes a form
                good and emotionally forgiving. It makes me consider past forms I have completed and not completed, and why that might
                be.</p>
                
                <p>The most frustrating forms I've done are the ones that require information that I don't want to give or that require
                me to go to other pages to check for some kind of information. For example, there was a shop that had an input for the
                color of the desired product in the cart, but the color choices were not available on the same screen, so I had to go
                back to the product page to view the options, then had to memorize it and go back to the cart. This aligns with what
                I've read in this article, which highlights the biggest pain points in form design.</p>
                
                <p>One of the best examples of good form design I've encountered is the Canvas submission form. Based on the types of
                submissions, it limits the form options accordingly. The input boxes are properly sized to the content it accepts. It
                has helpful alerts to what is required to submit. The experience is overall pleasant.</p>

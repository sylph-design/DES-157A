                <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
                <img src="images/cows.png" alt="cows grazing in front of Switzerland mountains">
                <figcaption>Emily Du, 2025.</figcaption>
                <p>This scenic image of the mountains and grazing cows is from a trip Emily Du took on a hike in Switzerland. There is a strong sense of foreground and background in this image. The cows boldly in the foreground, smaller houses in the midground, and the mountains in the background receding into a light fog. Even though the mountains are the farthest away, they take up a majority of the space in the image, eliciting a sense of grandeur in its massive size. The fog enveloping the area washes out the colors, making everything more neutral and calming. This picture can be used more effectively by emphasizing its characteristics, so perhaps making the image large on the webpage will more effectively communicate the feeling of the size of the mountain dwarfing the viewer. Alternatively, having the image with smaller amounts of text can add to the mystery of the fogginess and remote nature of the setting.</p>
                <img src="images/cranes.png" alt="close up of paper cranes on a christmas tree">
                <figcaption>Stacy Phan, 2025.</figcaption>
                <p>The image I chose is of a close-up of a Christmas tree made of paper cranes that are written on. The zoomed in nature makes it more initially confusing as to where this image is being taken. I think the overwhelming feeling of this picture represents the sheer number of paper cranes the tree was made of. This tree was in a church in San Francisco, and each crane that decorates the Christmas tree is some kind of well wish towards the general public. The tree is thus imbued with festive spirit and gives everyone a feeling of community.</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>

                <p>The placement of images on websites that invoke interaction can be very engaging. Being given only pictorial information with little to no words leaves space for the audience to engage with and think about what the images might mean in a critical way. In a sense, they might fill in the gaps of their knowledge with an interpretation. This interpretation can tie in with the themes of the pictures to create a kind of narrative within the minds of the viewers. By presenting images in novel ways like through animations and interactions, it increases engagement and feelings of enjoyment.</p>
                <p>An example is the 100 Lost Species website, where users can scroll through a rotating gallery of animal illustrations and can click to zoom in on any of them. The layout of the pictures and the scrolling makes it feel like there are a lot of species, which incites a sense of awe and gets the user to think about how many species are extinct. </p>

                <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays</a>
                <p>Overlays can be useful for displaying information and forms that are small enough to fit onto an overlay, and can be
                useful if navigating to a new page is not optimal. This can be an issue for mobile users though, since overlays on
                mobile are significantly harder to feel comfortable on a mobile sized screen. Since a lot of internet traffic is on
                mobile devices, it is imperative that much consideration is put into making overlays on websites.</p>
                <p>Designers must take into account how the users are navigating the content in the overlay for accessibility and cognitive
                load. Overlays that are not initiated by the user may be instantly ignored and closed, and might even be annoying and
                make the user not enjoy the website experience. The information displayed or needed to be inputted must be clear and
                relevant to where the user is on the website do reduce confusion. Overlays should thus be used for vital information, or
                risk being ignored or an annoyance to the user.</p>

                <h2>Form Design Research</h2>
                <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>
                
                <p>Learning about the best practices for form design was very helpful for my understanding of what exactly makes a form
                good and emotionally forgiving. It makes me consider past forms I have completed and not completed, and why that might
                be.</p>
                
                <p>The most frustrating forms I've done are the ones that require information that I don't want to give or that require
                me to go to other pages to check for some kind of information. For example, there was a shop that had an input for the
                color of the desired product in the cart, but the color choices were not available on the same screen, so I had to go
                back to the product page to view the options, then had to memorize it and go back to the cart. This aligns with what
                I've read in this article, which highlights the biggest pain points in form design.</p>
                
                <p>One of the best examples of good form design I've encountered is the Canvas submission form. Based on the types of
                submissions, it limits the form options accordingly. The input boxes are properly sized to the content it accepts. It
                has helpful alerts to what is required to submit. The experience is overall pleasant.</p>
